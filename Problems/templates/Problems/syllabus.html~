<h2> Mat237Y - Advanced Calculus - May - August 2016</h2>

<p>Welcome to MAT237, a course in advanced calculus!</p>

<h3>Course Objectives</h3>

<p>The goal of this course is to present you with a basic working knowledge of the theory of differential and integral calculus for functions of multiple variables. There will be a split emphasis on both computation and theory. While the course does cover some rather elaborate and technical results, we do not expect the student to achieve this level of sophistication. Instead, our aim is that by the end of the course, each student should be comfortable constructing a clear, rigorous solution to a problem of moderate difficulty.</p>

<h3>Lecture Structure</h3>

<p> Every lecture will be constructed with the goal of conceptual comprehension. Evaluation will be based on the same philosophy. As such, this course will be impossible to pass through sheer memorization, and a student who depends upon memorization will not fare well. We encourage the students to focus on the following:<p>
<ul>
    <li> Understanding the <em>idea</em> behind definitions, theorems, and proofs. </li>
    <li> Honing your problem solving skills to be able to deal with new problems, rather than regurgitating algorithms. </li>
    <li> Constructing cogent arguments in support of your solutions. </li> 
</ul>

<p>The first two hours of every lecture will be taught using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_instruction">peer instruction</a>, a teaching method designed to have students actively learn in the classroom (and not just passively take notes). To succeed with this method, you will need to <strong>read the relevant sections ahead of class</strong>. In class we won't assume you understand everything you read, but we will assume that you've looked at the material at least once. </p>

<p>This video will give you a sense of what peer instruction looks like in the class.</p>

<p>The third hour of every lecture will be devoted to problem solving and computational practice. Come to class expecting to work on problems.</p>

<h3>The Big List</h3>

<p>We will be providing a Big List of Problems, sorted by section. These are questions specifically tailored to the learning objectives of this course. We guarantee that at least 50% of all questions which appear on the tests will be taken from this list.</p>

<p>We encourage students to work together in solving these questions, and any student who solves most of questions will be in an excellent position to do well. Tutorials will focus on providing help and partial solutions to some of the questions on The Big List, making tutorial attendance an attractive and useful time investment. We note that The Big List is too long to make solution memorization a viable strategy.</p>

<h3>The Course Website</h3>

<p>The website is designed to help you achieve your learning objectives. The Big List problems will be stored on it and you can store your solutions on it. Please make use of this and let us know how we could improve it.</p>

<h3>Our Expectations for You</h3> 

<p>This is a double-speed course which covers difficult material. It will be essential that you not fall behind, as there will not be many opportunities to catch up. If you do find yourself falling behind, you should immediately seek the help of the TAs and instructors to keep the gap from widening.</p>

<p>We expect you to engage the material honestly and thoughtfully. We expect you to get stuck repeatedly, but use the many resources available to you to get unstuck.</p>

<h3>Your Expectation for the Instructors</h3>

<p>Above all, you can expect that the instructors will be professional and respectful in every aspect of the course. You can expect that we will provide you with clear goals, clear assessment and provide you with the tools to succeed in the course. You can expect that the term tests and final exam will accurately reflect material, techniques and ideas covered in class. Tests will be marked fairly and will be returned within a week, barring exceptional circumstances. We will be receptive to your questions, comments and concerns and we will be accessible, both in our office hours and by email. You can expect that most emails will be responded to in a day or less.</p>

<h3>Grading Scheme</h3>

<p>Grade evaluation will be based on the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Three (3) midterms, 120 minutes in length. The midterms will have a weighting of (10%, 20%, 30%), with 10% assigned your lowest score and 30% assigned to your highest score.</li>
    <li> One (1) final exam, 180 minutes in length, worth 40% of the final grade. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Office Hours</h3>

<p>Tutorials and lectures are not enough time to address all student concerns, or sometimes students like to ask questions on material that was covered much earlier in the course. To facilitate these questions, both the TAs and instructors will be holding office hours throughout the term.</p>

	<li>Folland's <em>Advanced Calculus</em> is available at the book store and library; it is a secondary reference, it is not absolutely necessary for the course. </li>
	<li>Parker Glynn-Adey's notes from class will be available <a href="http://pgadey.wordpress.com/">here</a>. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>You are responsible for being familiar with all aspects of <a href="http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/osai">academic integrity</a>.</p>

<h3>Drop Down Date</h3>

For students who wish to drop down to MAT235, the deadline for doing so is June 3, 2016.

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

<p>If you have a learning need requiring an accommodation the University of Toronto recommends that students immediately register at <a href="http://www.accessibility.utoronto.ca/index.htm">Accessibility Services</a>.</p>

<ul>
    <li> Location: St. George Campus, Robarts Library, 1st Floor, 130 St. George Street</li>

</ul>

<p>OISE supports accommodations of students with special learning needs, which may be associated with learning disabilities, mobility impairments, functional/fine motor disabilities, acquired brain injuries, blindness and low vision, chronic health conditions, addictions, deafness and hearing loss, psychiatric disabilities, communication disorders and/or temporary disabilities, such as fractures and severe sprains, recovery from an operation, serious infections or pregnancy complications.</p>

<p>Carrie Chassels, Supervisor, Student and Personal Support Services in OISE Student Services is available to support OISE students who require accommodations. You can arrange an appointment to meet with Carrie by calling the Student Services front desk at 416-978-2277 or by visiting the front desk in person on OISE?s 8th floor.</p>

<p>You are also invited to communicate with the instructors at any time about your learning needs. Confidentiality of learning needs is respectfully and strictly maintained.</p>

<h3>Missing Work</h3>
<p> If you have an academic conflict for one of the tests (for example, a tutorial or lab for a different course), then the weight of that test will be transfered to the final exam on presentation of supporting documentation. <p>

<p>If you are unable to write any of the term tests for a legitimate reason, such as severe illness, this will also be accommodated. Students must notify us of the circumstance by email within 24 hours of the administration of the test, and all supporting documentation must be provided within one week of the administration of the test. In the event of illness, the only valid supporting documentation is a <a href="http://www.illnessverification.utoronto.ca/">Verification of Illness Form</a>.
